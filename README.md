A custom wordpress theme I built for my blog/portfolio

Most noteable is the custom widget i built located in functions.php. This widget allows you to add a photo of yourself with a short discription of yourself underneath.

Anyone may use or improve apon this theme.

The facebook, github, youtube, and rss buttons are hard-coded in the header.php. You will have to change those accordingly.

You may need to change the media queries to fit your needs if you add more items to the top menu.

You find under widgets a Portrait Widget. This is meant for the primary area and the search widget for the seconday area.
